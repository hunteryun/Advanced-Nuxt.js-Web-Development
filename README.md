# Advanced Nuxt.js Web Development

> Build universal (SSR) and static-generated (SSG) Vue.js applications using Nuxt.js and Composition API

This is the code repository for *Advanced Nuxt.js Web Development*, coming soon in 2023, authored by [Lau Tiam Kok](https://lauthiamkok.net/). For the time being, if you are interested in this course and have questions, please visit [lauthiamkok.net](https://lauthiamkok.net) to contact me.

## Course Overview

This repository is the successor of [*Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development*](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Nuxt.js-Web-Development). You can purchase the book of *Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development* from [packtpub.com](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-nuxtjs-web-development/9781789952698). If you have owned the book already, which is based on Nuxt.js 2, and would like to upgrade to Nuxt.js 3 and update the old NPM packages, frameworks, and tools, please use this repository to do so. However, bear in mind that the following dependencies and skills that are covered in *Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development* are not included in this repository and course:

* Webpack
* Backpack
* Vue CLI
* Vuex
* jQuery
* Zurb Foundation
* Swiper
* AOS
* Koa
* Express
* Keystone
* Axios
* VeeValidate (Vue form validation)
* Google OAuth/ Google APIs Node.js Client
* Prettier 
* ESLint
* jsdom
* AVA
* Nightwatch
* [Nuxt modules](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/modules)
* [Testing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/testing)

Testing in Nuxt.js 3 is still in development. The APIs and behaviors for testing your Nuxt.js applications may change in the near future. So testing will not be included in this course. For more info about testing in Nuxt.js 3, please check it out at [https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/testing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/testing). However, the following NPM packages, frameworks, and tools are included and used tightly in this course (items marked with * are not covered in *Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development*):

* Vite*
* Nitro*
* h3*
* Windi CSS*
* Pinia*
* ofetch*
* Native Node.js Fetch API*
* Gridsome*
* Nuxt Content*
* MongoDB
* RethinkDB
* MySQL
* Socket.IO
* WordPress REST API
* Apollo Server

Whether you are coming from its predecessor or not, you still can pick up and make use of *Advanced Nuxt.js Web Development* independently. Just like its predecessor, this course is more about using Nuxt.js to connect and communicate with other Node.js and PHP applications remotely, such as Nitro, h3, WordPress, and Apollo (GraphQL server). With this approach, you can keep your Nuxt.js applications as "thin" as possible while leveraging modern server-side technologies and applications. *Advanced Nuxt.js Web Development* is more focused on this idea than its predecessor. Hence, purely Vue.js-related skills are not covered in this course, such as:

* Passing down data to child components with `defineProps`
* Emitting data up to parent components with `defineEmits`
* Lazy-loading components with `defineAsyncComponent` and lazy-loading images
* Creating custom form inputs with `v-model` support
* Validating form inputs
* Creating Vue.js SSR applications using Vite SSR

If you are also interested in the preceding Vue.js essential knowledge and skills, please consider [*Advanced Vue.js Web Development*](https://github.com/lautiamkok/Advanced-Vue.js-Web-Development) too in your learning journey. You can check out [this page](https://lauthiamkok.net/origins/digital/advanced-vuejs-web-development) for how to purchase the course guide. Most importantly, *Advanced Nuxt.js Web Development* is a concise version of its predecessor. Hence, the basic and entry-level knowledge and skills are not included in this course, such as:

* What is a Vue component?
* Creating custom Vue transitions
* Writing basic MongoDB queries
* Writing MongoDB CRUD operations
* What is middleware?
* Understanding Vue transitions
* Understanding `v-model`
* Understanding session-based authentication
* What are sessions and cookies?
* The session authentication flow
* Understanding token-based authentication
* What are JSON Web Tokens?
* The token authentication flow
* Understanding HTTP messages 
* Introducing PHP and PSRs (PHP Standards Recommendations)
* Understanding the GraphQL schema and resolvers
* Understanding GraphQL default resolvers
* Understanding classic SPAs and Nuxt SPAs
* Developing a SPA with Nuxt
* Deploying a SPA and deploying to GitHub Pages
* Creating backend and frontend authentications
* Installing and securing MySQL, MongoDB, and RethinkDB
* Installing and configuring Apache, PHP, and WordPress

If you are also interested in the preceding general knowledge and skills for Nuxt.js applications, please consider [*Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development*](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-nuxtjs-web-development/9781789952698) too in your learning journey. *Advanced Nuxt.js Web Development* assumes you have the preceding basic knowledge and skills already. Composition API and `<script setup>` are used solely throughout the course. In other words, [Options API](https://vuejs.org/api/#options-api) and `<script>` are considered basic in this course so they are opted out entirely from the course.
